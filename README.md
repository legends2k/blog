# To Do

* Update _Projects_ page with _Spirit of C++_, path finding, etc.
* [Self-host fonts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25300396)
* Make footnote as tool tip for hypertext using title attribute
* Create a site map with all sections articles as a one page searchable list
  - Index is big and only shows 7; everyone mightn’t tap ‘Older Posts’
* Enable [per-page auto-numbering](https://codingnconcepts.com/hugo/auto-number-headings-hugo/)
  - Remove manual numbering in `note/site_customizations.md`
* Move away from Disqus for comments
  - [staticman](https://staticman.net/); see [example](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html)
  - [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) and [gitment](https://github.com/imsun/gitment) have the issue of not letting non-GitHub users in
* Tag pages doesn’t show article’s published date and time
* Post/note index page doesn’t show tags of posts in the list
* Taxonomy: add **Categories**
    * Show both *Tag*s and *Category*s on a post
