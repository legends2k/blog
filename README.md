# To Do

* Create a site map with all sections and their articles as a
  simple searchable list
* Tag pages doesn’t show article’s published date and time
* Post/note index page doesn’t show tags of posts in the list
* Consider moving to CC-BY-SA
    + Would this also enable one to include CC pictures here?
* Taxonomy: add **Categories**
    * Show both *Tag*s and *Category*s on a post
