I’m a graphics programmer; I enjoy learning the math behind a domain — how its careful application elegantly solves complex problems.  I’m also an open-source contributor passionate about [knowledge sharing](https://stackoverflow.com/users/183120/legends2k).

> I live in Emacs and love the command-line.

I have enjoyed working on an [array of projects](/projects).  Here’s [my CV](https://bbcdn.githack.com/rmsundaram/tryouts/raw/bba90197e2958d08cc11da31aca34237e5f29418/Misc/resume/resume.html).
