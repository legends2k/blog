Giving form to thoughts make them powerful; without form ideas are quite useless.  Mere ponderings or musings may seem to give clarity in the short run but they do not build the kind of intuition one needs to finally get insights.  More often, without concretising, they lead to magical thinking abeted by perceptive and cognitive errors.

Practises like *rubber ducking*, talking to a shrink, observing the sensations of breath --- as opposed to thinking about breathing --- are some good examples, from different fields, of how misconceptions are cleared by bringing them to the realm of reality.  By substantiating one's thought stream out in the open, giving form to them, lets one test its vitality or the lack thereof.

This is where [I](/about) try to give form to my thoughts with words, images and code.  I hope it helps someone down the road to intuition.
