I tried upgrading the firmware of my old iOmega 1 TB HDD.  Internally itâ€™s a _Barracuda LP_ family, ST31000520AS model Segate HDD.  Seagate had released a [firmware upgrade][] for this drive in 2010.  Iâ€™m around 9 years late to the party!

My laptop doesnâ€™t have a CD-ROM drive, also I prefer burning the ISO to a USB stick --- why waste a CD, eh?  [Rufus][] kindly refused as the supplied Seagate update ISOâ€™s boot format was unrecognizable.  In the process, Iâ€™d tried using another tool -- _RMPrepUsb_ -- in vain.  Itâ€™d done something, owing to some option I chose of course, to overwrite GRUB2 with Windows boot loader --- some `BCDedit` command I guess.  My meddling with BIOS didnâ€™t help either as GRUB wasnâ€™t even listed in _EFI order_, so I reverted to orignial settings[^1]:

| Setting     | Value                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Boot Mode   | UEFI                                             |
| USB Boot    | Enabled                                          |
| EFI order   | GRUB, Windows Boot Manager, EFI PXE Network      |
| Secure Boot | Disabled                                         |
| Fast Boot   | Enabled                                          |

Thanks to [Debianâ€™s GrubEFIReinstall guide][]; it made me recall that the _Boot Mode_ should be UEFI; it also gave the way to verify it.  Iâ€™d to use a UEFI-bootable[^2] USB stick with Arch Linux ISO.  Things were smooth thereon!

{{< highlight basic >}}
root@archiso / # [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo "EFI boot on HDD" || echo "Legacy boot on HDD"
EFI boot on HDD
root@archiso / # mount /dev/lvmg1/root /mnt
root@archiso / # mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /mnt/boot
root@archiso / # mount /dev/lvmg1/home /mnt/home
root@archiso / # mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/var
root@archiso / # swapon /dev/sda6
root@archiso / # arch-chroot /mnt
{{< /highlight >}}

Once [chroot][]ed[^3], Iâ€™d to reinstall GRUB to fix the issue!

{{< highlight basic >}}
> mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi
> grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
{{< /highlight >}}

All is well now ðŸ˜€

# GRUB missing in UEFIâ€™s NVRAM

On an ArchLinux box (host) with UEFI + GPT setup, Iâ€™d to install Ubuntu on an external SSD, for a machine having legacy BIOS (target).  I booted host in _Legacy Boot_ mode and installed Ubuntu by marking the first primary partition on the SSD _bootable_; everything went well.  Rebooting showed GRUB on the SSD with both Ubuntu and ArchLinnux.  Since target machine wonâ€™t have Arch, Iâ€™d to turn off os-prober and regenerate GRUB configuration file [^4]:

{{< highlight basic >}}
# cat >> /etc/default/grub
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true

# update-grub
{{< /highlight >}}

However, after switching back to _UEFI Boot_, I only saw _Windows Boot Manager_ and _EFI PXE Network_ options; GRUB was missing!  Mounting the EFI System Partition (ESP) showed GRUB under `/EFI/GRUB/grubx64.efi`, so itâ€™s just the NVRAM GRUB was removed from.  Reinstalling GRUB by booting from an Arch Linux ISO is an option, but I didnâ€™t want to lose my GRUB customizations like wallpaper, etc.  [Thanks to a good Unix.SE answer][efibootmgr-grub] helped me put GRUB back in NVRAM

{{< highlight bash >}}
# -c creates an entry with -l taking path in ESP at /dev/nvme0n1p1
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1 -p 1 -l \\EFI\\GRUB\\grubx64.efi -L GRUB

* [Debianâ€™s GrubEFIReinstall guide][] -- like most Debian documents, thorough!
* [GRUB2 & EFI Recovery Tutorial][] seems to be a detailed guide with multiple methods; I only glanced it.
* [Firmware update Seagate HDD using Linux][] uses `hdparm` to do it on Linux; something the OEM doesnâ€™t support.  I didnâ€™t have to resort to it.  I dunno if this wouldâ€™ve worked if the HDD was connected via USB.

# HDD Upgrade Story

Those still reading to know about the poor â€™ol HDDâ€™s fate, read on!  It ends well :)

I created a plain _Free DOS_ bootable USB with Rufus; extracted the IMA floppy image to root; this worked since the update ISO was also using Free DOS.  The tool, booted with Free DOS, still couldnâ€™t do the deed!  It couldnâ€™t detect the drive that was connected via USB; [I realised][ManualFirmwareUpgrade] that it expects BIOS to be set to ATA; neither AHCI nor RAID -- the only options mine has.  

Luckily my 2006 desktop (AMD Phenom X4 machine) had the SATA option (in addition to the other two)!  I didnâ€™t even have to resort to a force firmware write, the tool did it straight-forward.  I didnâ€™t connect it via USB though; I opened the iOmega case, connected the internal HDD directly to the motherboardâ€™s SATA power and data connectors.

Before firmware upgrade `smartctl` warned about an older firmware.

[^1]: GRUB is present in _EFI Order_ since this was made after the recovery.
[^2]: This is rather important; a legacy boot USB stick wouldnâ€™t be bootable when _Boot Mode_ is UEFI.
[^3]: This is important too; without chrooting file paths would be off.
[^4]: Modern machines have `grub-mkconfig` instead of `update-grub`
