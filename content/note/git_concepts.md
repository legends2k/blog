- Git is a distributed VCS; each repo can be both a server/client
- Honestly, `git` (sub)commands are just graph manipulating commands
- Every codebase is made of a graph; each commit is a node with edges to parent(s)
  - Git diagrams often have arrows backwards for this reason only
- Git stores [snapshots not differences][] i.e. entire file contents --- as a blob
  - Every commit is a complete [snapshot of tracked repo contents + (0 or more) parent ID(s)][commit composition] identified with a 40-byte SHA1-digested hash
  - This way, the exact state of your project can be referred to, copied, or restored at any time

# Reachablity

- An important (linked-list) concept that applies here too
  - If `void* first` is lost, the list, too, is lost
- Since a commit also has (0+) parent commits, following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the beginning of the project
- In a well-branched graph, depending on the leaf node you start from, [different parts of the graph will be _reachable_][reachability]
- [Commit X is "reachable" from commit Y if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y][reachability-pro-git]
  - In the above example, `A`, `B` and `C` are unreachable from `G`, so are `F` and `G` when starting from `C` or `B` or `A`
- The `gc` subcommand walks through the graph, building a list of every commit it can reach; removes unreachable ones
  - Will clear-up disk space; no good reason to run it often
  - Some Git subcommands [may run it automatically][gc-man-page] too!

# Refs

> "References make commits reachable"
>   -- [Think like a Git][references-commits]

- Plainly, [references][Refs] are "meaningful" names to some commits
  - Branches and tags are references too
    - Creating a branch is a way to "nail down" part of the graph that you want to return to later `[reachability]`
  - Theyâ€™re specific to a single repository
- They facilitate easy git-speak with your friends/colleagues ðŸ˜œ
- [Internally][ref-internal] just a 40-byte file containing a commit ID
  - Remote references point to commits in remote repositories
- Thereâ€™re many more ways of referring to commits: `man gitrevisions` is your friend

## Commands Affecting Refs

Only these `git` subcommands allow you to move refs:

- `commit`
- `merge`
- `rebase`
- `reset`

Subcommands that affect moving remote refs:

- `fetch`
- `push`

Commands like `cherry-pick` internally use one of these.
