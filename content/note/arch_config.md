# Network

In the newly installed Arch you might notice that there's no network connectivity.  To enable do what you did during installation (see _Arch Linux Installation_, [Â§2 Wireless Network][]).  I did it only to realize, for `netctl` to hook to a WPA-secured network, the `wpa_supplicant` package is needed but was absent on the installed system.  To connect to the internet, you need a package from the internet!?  To get out of this Catch 22 situation, I'd to reboot from the installation USB, setup network and install `wpa_supplicant` to the new OS by chrooting

{{< highlight basic >}}
root@archiso / # mount /dev/lvmg1/root /mnt
root@archiso / # mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /mnt/boot
root@archiso / # mount /dev/lvmg1/home /mnt/home
root@archiso / # mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/var
root@archiso / # swapon /dev/sda6
root@archiso / # arch-chroot /mnt
[root@archiso /]# pacman -S wpa_supplicant
[root@archiso /]# exit
root@archiso / # reboot
{{< /highlight >}}

To permanently enable a network on boot, enable the service

{{< highlight basic >}}
netctl enable infoprobe
{{< /highlight >}}

If on every boot you get this with a long wait

{{< highlight basic >}}
[***      ] A start job is running for dhcpcd on wlp3s0 (14 s / 1min 30s).
{{< /highlight >}}

As [discussed in the forums][dhcp_job] set `/etc/systemd/system/systemd-user-sessions.service`

{{< highlight cfg >}}
[Unit]

According to Arch Wikiâ€™s [domain name resolution][]

> The `Glibc` resolver provides only the most basic necessities, it does not cache queries nor provides any security features. If you require more functionality, use another resolver.

However, another statement admonitions that a router usually does this caching at the network-level, so you can skip setting up a more robust resolver.

# Resurrecting Windows

On a dual boot setup, if you notice that _Windows_ isâ€™t an option in the boot menu, install the `os-prober` package.  Mount the EFI partition and re-run GRUB config maker:

{{< highlight basic >}}
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
{{< /highlight >}}

_Windows_ would come up as an option now, as the prober would be able to _see_ the Windows installation.

# Real Time Clock Setup

Traditionally RTC --- h/w clock that doesnâ€™t understand time standards --- is set in local time; Windows reads it as local by default; Linux doesnâ€™t.  It recommends setting it in GMT and let the OS services deal with time zone and DST variations.  Forcing Linux with `timedatectl set-local-rtc 1` is possible.  However, `man timedatectl` warns that it will create problems when changing time zones and DST changes; one has to rely on booting into Windows [at least twice annually][Linux localtime sync] (in Spring and Fall) for DST adjustments.  Setting RTC in GMT seems appropriate (macOS does this too).  [A registry change][UTC in Windows] + restart will make Windows read RTC as GMT too.  This is the recommended way of setting time in dual boot machines.  For time sync to an [NTP][] server, do `timedatectl set-ntp true`.  Do `timedatectl status` to check if everything is OK:

# Desktop Environment

To have _Xfce_ up and running, you need a display system (_Xorg_; Xfce canâ€™t run atop _Wayland_ yet) and a display manager (_LXDM_)

{{< highlight basic >}}
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed xorg xorg-server xfce4 xfce4-goodies lxdm xf86-input-synaptics
{{< /highlight >}}

Once done, enable (for future boots) and start the display manager

{{< highlight basic >}}
systemctl enable lxdm.service
systemctl start lxdm.service
{{< /highlight >}}

For the first run, make sure to set the _Session_ and _Locale_; not doing so led to a login screen loop.

For natural scrolling with laptopâ€™s touchpad, similar to iPad, enabling _Reverse scroll direction_ under _Mouse and Touchpad_ settings; this fixes scroll in most places except _Terminal_ ðŸ˜¬.

For sanity, [disable desktop zoom][] "feature" in  _Settings Editor_ â†’ _xfwm4_; uncheck `zoom_desktop`.

[disable desktop zoom]: https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=41556#p41556

# Display

I got infinite waits every time I tried `poweroff -n` due to Nouveau drivers for Nvidia; for this reason I disabled `lxdm.service` and operated from the terminal.  To list the graphics devices youâ€™ve, do

{{< highlight basic >}}
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
{{< /highlight >}}

## Intel

To get Intel graphics working

{{< highlight basic >}}
pacman -S --needed xf86-video-intel mesa mesa-demos
{{< /highlight >}}

With Skylake and its successors (Kabylake, â€¦) we can enable `i915` module for [early KMS start] in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and run `mkinitcpio -p linux`

{{< highlight cfg >}}
# MODULES
# â€¦
MODULES=(i915)
{{< /highlight >}}

Enable GuC, HuC and FBC in `/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf`

{{< highlight basic >}}
options i915 enable_guc=-1 enable_fbc=1
{{< /highlight >}}

Screen tearing when scrolling large walls of text in Firefox is a common occurrence.  To fix this set `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` to

{{< highlight basic >}}
Section "Device"
    Identifier "Intel Graphics"
    Driver "intel"
    Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
{{< /highlight >}}

The Intel device needs only these but still I couldnâ€™t `startx` or `systemctl start lxdm.service`; even if stuff shows up, it usually hung during power down sequence.  All because the Nvidia device was preferred over Intel's and its drivers were broken.

[early KMS start]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_mode_setting#Early_KMS_start

## Nvidia

Switching between Nouveau and proprietary drivers (both `nvidia` and `nvidia-lts`), mucking around with `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`, creating and tweaking `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf`, running `nvidia-xconfig` and `nvidia-settings` --- none of these worked!  Enter [Bumblebee][] and voilÃ !

Remove all nouveau-related and install Nvidia-supplied packages.  Install Bumblebee and friends:

{{< highlight basic >}}
pacman -Rs nouveau xf86-video-nouveau libvdpau
pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
pacman -S bumblebee primus bbswitch
{{< /highlight >}}

Make sure at least these entries are set right in `/etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf`:

{{< highlight cfg >}}
[bumblebeed]
ServerGroup=bumblebee
Driver=nvidia

[driver-nvidia]
KernelDriver=nvidia
{{< /highlight >}}

In order to use Bumblebee, add user to `bumblebee` group

{{< highlight basic >}}
gpasswd -a root bumblebee
{{< /highlight >}}

Start the _Bumblebee_ service to see if things work as expected; enable for service start across reboots.

{{< highlight basic >}}
systemctl start bumblebeed.service
systemctl enable bumblebeed.service
{{< /highlight >}}

Once all the setting up is done, you could choose between the GPUs when running a process.  `optirun` the process to choose Nvidia; the default would be Intel:

{{< highlight basic >}}
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL Renderer"
glxgears -info
optirun glxgears -info
{{< /highlight >}}

Running _glxgears_ with and without `optirun` should show the right GPU selected for the demo running.

Once in a while, you might get this error when `optirun`nig something

{{< highlight basic >}}
[  146.868249] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: [XORG] (EE) NVIDIA(GPU-0): Failed to initialize the NVIDIA GPU at PCI:1:0:0.  Please
[  146.868250] [ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.
{{< /highlight >}}

The [fix in ArchWiki][failed GPU init] says

{{< highlight basic >}}
su
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/remove
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
{{< /highlight >}}

This doesnâ€™t work very consistently though.

[failed GPU init]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee#Failed_to_initialize_the_NVIDIA_GPU_at_PCI:1:0:0_(Bumblebee_daemon_reported:_error:_[XORG]_(EE)_NVIDIA(GPU-0))

# (Pulse) Audio

Just install `pulseaudio`, `pulseaudio-alsa`, `pavucontrol` and `xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin`; little to no configuring seems to be needed to get audio working.  I set _Built-in Audio_ to _Analog Stereo Output_ since this laptop has stereo out only.

# Bluetooth

Install `bluez`, `bluez-utils` and `blueman` -- for a decent GTK+ bluetooth manager with an applet.  Verify if bluetooth hardware is not hard blocked but is soft blocked.

{{< highlight basic >}}
> rfkill list highlight
1: ideapad_bluetooth: Bluetooth
	Soft blocked: yes
	Hard blocked: no
3: hci0: Bluetooth
	Soft blocked: yes
	Hard blocked: no
{{< /highlight >}}

As mentioned in ArchWiki

> By default the bluetooth daemon will only give out bnep0 devices to users that are a member of the `lp` group.

Create and add yourself to it.

{{< highlight basic >}}
groups $USER            # check if user already in lp
groupadd lp
useradd -G lp $USER
{{< /highlight >}}

Enable and start `bluetooth.service`.

{{< highlight basic >}}
systemctl --now enable bluetooth.service
{{< /highlight >}}

Though this is enough, at every login, thereâ€™d be an annoying prompt for the root password, to enable bluebooth.  Add this to `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/51-blueman.rules` to not prompt for users in the `sudo` group as [detailed in the Wiki][Blueman_permissions]:

{{< highlight cfg >}}
/* Allow users in sudo group to use blueman feature requiring root without authentication */
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if ((action.id == "org.blueman.network.setup" ||
         action.id == "org.blueman.dhcp.client" ||
         action.id == "org.blueman.rfkill.setstate" ||
         action.id == "org.blueman.pppd.pppconnect") &&
        subject.isInGroup("sudo")) {

        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
{{< /highlight >}}

If after every login bluetooth is auto-powered ON; this is due to Bluemanâ€™s _Power Manager_ plugin.  [Fix][Bluetooth No Auto-ON]: right-click Blueman applet â†’ Plugins â†’ PowerManager â†’ Configuration; uncheck _Auto Power-on_.
<!-- TODO: update this in Arch Wiki - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth#Auto_power-on_after_boot -->

The default Obex push directory is set to `~/.cache/obex`, named `Root`; change it to your convenience in _Local services_ -> _Transfer_.

# Laptop Power Saving

`laptop-mode-tools` seems to be an important package for a laptopâ€™s power saving.  Additionally you need `hdparm` and `cpupower`

{{< highlight basic >}}
yay -S --needed laptop-mode-tools hdparm cpupower
{{< /highlight >}}

Start with `sudo systemctl enable laptop-mode.service`.  Then set the following parameters in respective files

{{< highlight cfg >}}
# /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/intel-sata-powermgmt.conf
CONTROL_INTEL_SATA_POWER="1"

# /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/lcd-brightness.conf
BRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT="/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
CONTROL_BRIGHTNESS=1

# /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf
BATT_HD_POWERMGMT=200
LM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT=240
{{< /highlight >}}

Verify if last setting is in action with `hdparm -B /dev/sda`.

# Mount Removable Drives

If youâ€™re dual booting, mounting NTFS partitions/disks is common; and then thereâ€™re USB drives too.  Though `/etc/fstab` is the traditional route for NTFS mounting, I donâ€™t like this approach since this assumes you always need these drives.  Also you need empty directories ready to use as mount points for these drives.  Itâ€™d be good to do this automatically, on demand.

Enter [`udisks2`][udisks2] -- [the most-recommended approach][udisk recommendation]; many desktop environments seem to use it too.  This approach is intelligent compared to `fstab`â€™s plain hard-coding; respects per-user or group permissions; mount points are user-based too; having a [common mount point][] is also possible.  Install `udisks2` for conveniently mounting NTFS partitions and removable (USB) disks from the command-line or in [Thunar][].

{{< highlight basic >}}
yay -S --needed udisks2
{{< /highlight >}}

To allow users of group `sudo` to mount NTFS drives (with write permissions) without asking for `root` password, [enable the group in _polkit_][polkit sudo mount] under `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-udisks.rules`

{{< highlight cfg >}}
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
  var YES = polkit.Result.YES;
  var permission = {
    // only required for udisks2:
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-system": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.encrypted-unlock": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.power-off-drive": YES,
    // required for udisks2 if using udiskie from another seat (e.g. systemd):
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-other-seat": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.encrypted-unlock-other-seat": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media-other-seat": YES,
    "org.freedesktop.udisks2.power-off-drive-other-seat": YES
  };
  if (subject.isInGroup("sudo")) {
    return permission[action.id];
  }
});
{{< /highlight >}}

From now on, you should see NTFS and USB disk partitions in Thunarâ€™s sidebar.  On click mount and unmount will work.

[Thunar]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth#Auto_power-on_after_boot

## Mount/unmount from command-line

Un/mounting from the comfort of your command-line is even better.  Since youâ€™d know your NTFS drivesâ€™ `/dev`, so you could

{{< highlight basic >}}
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda3                         # NTFS disks
udisksctl unmount --block-device /dev/sda3
{{< /highlight >}}

Iâ€™ve a convenient Lua script to mount and unmount an array of NTFS partitions with a single command

{{< highlight basic >}}
#! /bin/env lua

local cmd = (#arg > 0) and (arg[1] == "u") and "unmount" or "mount"

os.execute("udisksctl " .. cmd .. " --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/Windows")
os.execute("udisksctl " .. cmd .. " --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/Data")
os.execute("udisksctl " .. cmd .. " --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/Media")
os.execute("udisksctl " .. cmd .. " --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/Backup")
{{< /highlight >}}

Since youâ€™d be having `udev` running, it should [populate][by-label populator] `/dev/disk/by-label` which might be useful for USB drives.

{{< highlight basic >}}
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/CAPSULE
udisksctl unmount --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/CAPSULE
udisksctl power-off --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/CAPSULE    # power-off before unplug
{{< /highlight >}}

A recommended GUI, if needed, is [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie).

# Package Management - Yay!

Many essential packages live in [AUR][], the unofficial Arch repository; just the official repositories wonâ€™t cut it.  The default package manager client `pacman` works only with official repos.  Many famous [AUR helpers][] and [pacman wrappers][] have been written hence.  The former deals only with AUR packages, while letting `pacman` work with the official repo packages; the latter is more wholesome.  Pacman wrappers take care of both official and AUR repos; effectively letting the user deal with both transparently e.g. `yay -Syu` updates all packages irrespective of their repo.

[Yay][] --- the pacman wrapper written in [Go][] --- simple interface, feature-rich and an active project.  I recommend it over the many, now-defunct, pacman wrappers out there.  Once installed, Yay should take care of your AUR (and official repo) package needs.  However, to get Yay itself, you need to do manual AUR package installation.  To make packages from AUR you need the `base-devel` package group and super user permissions; you canâ€™t `sudo` before getting added to the group, so

{{< highlight basic >}}
pacman -S --needed base-devel
su
visudo                      # uncomment sudo group
groupadd sudo               # if not already existing
gpasswd -a sundaram sudo
{{< /highlight >}}

Now install Yay from AUR

{{< highlight basic >}}
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay/
makepkg -si    # this needs sudo to install built pacakge
{{< /highlight >}}

I [found][Package Mapping] a couple of useful tricks as (my machineâ€™s) admin:

* Map an existing file back to its (installed) package: `pacman -Qo FILE-PATH`
{{< highlight basic >}}
> pacman -Qo mandelbrot
/usr/bin/mandelbrot is owned by mesa-demos 8.4.0-1
{{< /highlight >}}
* Map any command/file name (not necessarily existing) to its (to-be-installed) package: `pkgfile FILE`
{{< highlight basic >}}
> pkgfile hexl
extra/emacs
community/emacs-nox
{{< /highlight >}}

# Draft

* Archive manager
    - Install packages: `p7zip`, `unzip`, `unrar`
    - GUI `xarchiver` which should integrate with Thunar; [issue](https://github.com/ib/xarchiver/issues/62) of preferences not persistant, fixed by a workaround
* Lock screen
    - `xlockmore` works fine, just be aware that switching to TTY (with Ctrl + Alt + 2, ...) is still possible with it
    - Integrates seamlessly with `xflock4` a script (`/usr/bin/xflock4`) which tries different lockers
    - Other lockers have issues
        - Donâ€™t work (e.g. _gnome-screensaver_)
        - Is not in the official repos (e.g. _sflock_ and also didnâ€™t work)
        - Only `root` can unlock (e.g. _physlock_)
        - Need a DM (e.g. _light-lock_)
- Install at least DejaVu Sans, Symbola, Quivira and Noto TTFs as recommended by [unicode-fonts](https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts) for good Unicode coverage
* Install fontconfig and use `fc-list` to see fonts available
* `yay -S --needed fontconfig ttf-dejavu ttf-symbola ttf-tamil ttf-ubuntu-font-family noto-fonts ttf-mononoki`
    * Install fonts not any repo by copying into `${HOME}/.local/share/fonts` e.g. Quivira
* Noto Sans and Mononoki are good system-wide regular and mono fonts -- set in _Appearance_
* Setting system-wide monospace font through _Appearance_ setting alone isnâ€™t enough; it fixes neither Terminal nor Mousepadâ€™s fonts; overriding each manually seems silly
    - `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name 'Ubuntu Mono 16'` does the trick for Terminal
      - This also seems to fix `markdown-mode`â€™s inline code face
    - Customizing font config per-user: `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf`
    - See [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/106070/changing-monospace-fonts-system-wide) for both options

1. To enable Tamil in browser (and other interfaces), Iâ€™d to do

{{< highlight basic >}}
pacman -S --needed ttf-tamil firefox-i18n-ta
{{< /highlight >}}

1. For screenshots, Xfce has `xfce4-screenshooter` which has to be hooked to <kbd>PrintScr</kbd> through `xfce4-keyboard-settings` under the _Application Shortcuts_ tab.
2. _Edit with Emacs_ to use `emacsclient` see https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/14055/4106
3. Install Xfce4 terminal colour scheme into `${HOME}/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`; pick-up from [iTerm2 Color Schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
4. Use `rclone` package to sync remote drives like OneDrive.  [Make it a VFS](https://www.everything-linux-101.com/blog/mount-onedrive-in-linux/) too!
5. Opening files in preferred app: `xdg-utils` (a dependency of packages like `mpv`, `blender`, etc.) has the command `xdg-open` useful to open file with preferred application from terminal; another option is to use `perl-file-mimeinfo`.  Xfce4 has _MIME Type Editor_ whose settings both MC and Thunar respects.  When something is unassociated and opened in Thunar, what you choose gets updated here only.
6. mpv for A/V playback, Handbrake for encoding and ffmpeg for conversions
7. evince for PDF, xCHM for CHMs and Bookworm for ePubs
8. Ristretto, part of `xfce4-goodies`, for image viewing; feh for quick command-line image viewing.

# Issues

1. Log out and in mouse cursor frozen
2. Screen locker with tty security but also works with Xfce4
3. Scroll neutralizing at all places

For the first run, make sure to set the _Session_ and _Locale_; not doing so led to a loop.
