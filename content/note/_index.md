Though programming, writing, cooking, etc. are fun to do, there are many mundane details needed to get the setup up to _dance the dance_.  Many a times I have seen practitioners (programmers, musicians, etc.) abandoning excellent tools only because it's very difficult to get a workable pipeline ready before getting productive; they get turned off and for good reason too.

To avoid figuring out these procedures once every few months, I write them here.  Unlike articles, these are notes I've written for personal consumption to skip remembering details not worth remembering but are nevertheless needed.  I hope these help others too.
