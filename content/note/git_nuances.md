Git has its oddities with unusual commands and flags.  I keep learning something new every now and then.

A decent understanding of [basic Git concepts][git-concepts] is a perquisite.

[git-concepts]: {{< relref "git_concepts.md" >}}

# `show` time!

The easiest way to see the diff introduced by a [reference][git-concepts-ref] is not `git diff`!

{{< highlight basic >}}
git show REF
{{< /highlight >}}

It shows details about the commit along with the changes it brings about.  Of course, you can control the amount of information thrown at you with the usual options `show` shares with `log`: `--name-status`, `--shortstat`, `--stat`, `--summary`, etc.

`show` can also give you a fileâ€™s clean copy from a commit --- very handy:

{{< highlight basic >}}
git show REF:path/to/a/file > file_copy
{{< /highlight >}}

`show` is a versatile command that can explain _any_ [Git object][git-object], not just references.

# Manâ€™s search for ~~meaning~~ config ðŸ˜›

Ever been annoyed by a Git setting you didnâ€™t set and didnâ€™t know where it comes from?

{{< highlight cfg >}}
git config --show-origin  --list

file:/usr/local/etc/gitconfig       credential.helper=osxkeychain
file:/Users/my_user/.gitconfig      user.name=John Q. Public
file:/tmp/Cool_Project/.gitconfig   core.pager=less --quit-if-one-screen --no-init
{{< /highlight >}}

will list all the settings along with the corresponding `.gitconfig` file itâ€™s coming from.

# You're on stage!

`git add` has some [good tricks][git-add-variations] up its sleeves:

{{< highlight basic >}}
git add .    # stage changes (untracked and tracked)
git add -u   # stage changes (tracked-only)
{{< /highlight >}}

`-n` dry runs `add` without actually staging anything; `-v` makes `add` tell what is staged.  If you want to stage only parts of a file, pass `-p` to interactively stage hunks of patch.

If youâ€™re sure of your changes and just want to `commit`, skipping the intermediate `add`

{{< highlight basic >}}
git commit -a
{{< /highlight >}}

This will auto-`add` all tracked, changed files and `commit`.

# Stuff that matters!

{{< highlight basic >}}
git ls-files [<pathspec>]
{{< /highlight >}}

lists only tracked files of the repository; it optionally takes a [pathspec][] argument.  Quite useful when youâ€™ve to separate the wheat from the chaff in a directory with many untracked files.

# Pull another branch

Contrary to popular belief, [`git pull` can be run on a branch thatâ€™s not current][pull-non-HEAD].  Say `HEAD` is attached to `master`, you can still pull in changes to `my-topic` branch from a remote.

{{< highlight basic >}}
git fetch origin my-topic:my-topic
{{< /highlight >}}

# Please [mind the dots][mind-gap]

`git diff A..B` = diff [(`A`, `B`\]][intervals] i.e. the diff includes changes made by `B` but not by `A`.  Since a diff-ing utility just takes a pair of file sets, with these references we simply denote the repository at different states -- after committing `A` and after committing `B`.  This diffs the repository at _two points_.

{{< highlight bash >}}
git diff A B    # same as below; only nicer
git diff A..B   # diff commits A and B
git diff A...B  # diff commits ancestor(A, B) and B
{{< /highlight >}}

`git diff A...B` = `git diff $(git merge-base A B) B` i.e. difference between the common ancestor of both references and `B`.  `A` is usually `HEAD` and `B` is commonly a branch head, so this shows work done independently in a branch.  _Memory aid_: triple dots â‰ˆ branch.

However, the [meanings feel reversed for `git log`][log-dots]!  ðŸ¤¦  Also `A..B` and `A B` mean the same in `diff` while not in `log`!  Before reading `log`â€™s nuances, remember that `log` operates on a range of commits while diff only does on two.  Also [Gitoliteâ€™s nice observation][triple-dot] might help you internalise `...` better:

> `...` somehow involves the common ancestor for both `diff` and `log`

{{< highlight bash >}}
git log A B    # (1) show A âˆª B commits (till root)
git log A..B   # (2) show B-only commits
git log A...B  # (3) show A-only and B-only commits
{{< /highlight >}}

`log` takes a commit and lists all the way to its root, unless an end point is given.  This explains (1); for (2) since `A` wouldnâ€™t be reachable from `B` it stops at the common ancestor.  (3) has `...` so it involves the common ancestor; since both `A` and `B` can be reached from it, it lists bothâ€™s history up-to the ancestor.

[Pro Git v2 explains][pro-git-log] these in `git log`â€™s context.

# Overloaded `checkout`

Keep getting confused between the various tasks that the overloaded `checkout` command performs?  Itâ€™s used to create new branches, switch branches and restore files from the index or a reference.  You donâ€™t have to use it much these days; [Git 2.23 added two very useful commands][switch-restore-release] to remedy the situation[^1]:

{{< highlight bash >}}
# create new branch
git switch -c shiny-topic-branch

# switch BRANCH
git switch master

# restore hello from index
git restore hello

# restore hello from commit 1fe35f
git restore --source 1fe35f hello

# restore hello in index from HEAD
git restore --staged hello

# restore hello in both index and working tree from 1fe35f
git restore --WS --source 1fe35f hello
