# Ideas

When we’re young, people tell us how to talk, how to socialize, how to deal with money matters, etc.  It’s done to the point where it’s preachy and rightly so.  Why?  More than what you say, kids pick up what you _do_.  Words don’t mean much to them; [actions speak much louder][AJCronin] indeed.

When we’re adults, we read motivational text, watch TED talks, discuss our problems with our friends and get ideas/free advice all the time on how to tackle.

You want to take the stairs to your work floor everyday.  You make a pact with yourself; next day you get reminded of the pact while the elevator door dings.  So what’s missing?

We get a lot of ideas and tips.  In this information age, they’re abundant to the point of becoming boring.  Yet, why don’t we all end up showing them in action?  Let aside _all_, not even _many_.  Majority of adults (and some kids[^1]), find it hard to change a habit?

> Invariably, we’re fed with ideas; when [armchair theorizing][] they sound great too.  When it comes to doing it, at that moment, it’s a totally different ball game.

Everyone knows what to do.  How to do, however, has eluded us.

# The Mind

It’s great to have a [beginner’s mind][]; while an expert’s busy explaining how _new_ is actually _old_, a beginner accepts _new_ as it is; works with it.  However, it’s just plain reality that most of us don’t have a beginner’s mind and we’ve habits.  How then do we effect change then?  Let’s see how the mind works at a coarse level to understand behaviours.

[Neural pathway][]s are formed when you do a new _action_; bits of technique, from the new experience, is learnt.  As you continue doing similar actions, the pathways become stronger and denser; more connections are made to other parts of your cortex.  Once these pathways are quite established, it’s like a freeway to involuntary action.  Speaking while driving[^2], anyone?  Yes, that’s _[muscle memory][]_.  It’s not just committed to memory but is autonomous.  And this isn’t a good thing when the pathway is to reach for another cigarette.

> Your conscious brain acts ~~nice~~ prude when you think consciously, _but_ your subconscious, the final authority, isn’t as nice.

It might come to many as a surprise but this is just the hard truth.  The subconscious loves habits.  Since it doesn’t work consciously, to make decisions quickly, it just takes shortcuts.

# Action

[Negativity bias][] is a common trait for _all_ humans.  Most can, when they sit and think, think positive things.  Yet if you’re not conscious enough[^3], you slowly go back to your old ways of cribbing, sulking and be disgruntled.  Why?

> Most of the ideas we get, most of the resolutions we make are all just **thoughts**: electric impulses along existing neural nets and they’re **just not enough**™

Do we need more current across our existing pathways or new pathways themselves?  The latter, of course!

Newer alternative pathway is needed to steer away from taking the old route.  For that good ol’ _action_ is needed!  When I suggest people to write a happiness log, people go, "I know I can think of these positive thoughts, why record them everyday?  It seems silly to write down what I already know".  Well, there’s our problem.  Knowing is not enough, doing is.  Writing a log is perhaps silly but what it does to your brain isn’t.

> An ounce of experience is worth a ton of theory.

Wanna lower your anger after identifying what pushes your buttons?  Write[^4] and stick a big wall poster.  No, that poster isn’t gonna calm you down.  What does?  The more you see it, the more your subconscious realizes that you’re serious enough to change something that you’ve shown it in action.  _The poster is a symbol of your action_; a commitment beacon.

Motivation speakers, at least the more practical ones, suggest to make flash cards, write small logs of change every day, etc.  When you do these small action everyday, incrementally, you change yourself without exerting a lot of effort: a lot of change intimidates your brain and you get burned out.  So the two key takeaways

1. _Act_
2. Act _small_

In a couple of weeks, you should see something tangible as a product of your incremental changes; this puts you in a virtuous feedback loop.  You’re well on your way to changing/re-programming yourself 👍

# Bottom line

Most of humanity keeps ideating but little gets done; most keep talking but seldom listen.

> Wanna be a great driver, drive more![^5]
> Aspire becoming a great talker[^6], listen more!

Perhaps this is one of the reason why Zen recommends listening over talking, doing to thinking.  Know this [title](https://www.quora.com/What-does-if-you-meet-the-Buddha-on-the-road-kill-him-mean)?

> If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!

In order to see the Buddha, you have to _be_ the Buddha.  If you aren't the Buddha, you can't really understand the Buddha.

Talking, reading and thinking about something doesn’t get you there; doing will.

[^1]: Kids are fairly adaptable since their minds are fresh: a great advantage -- the beginner’s mind.

[^2]: Without being mindful about driving; sometimes called _auto-piloting_.

[^3]: There are some ways around this but are very demanding: _mind sculpting_, a fairly recent technique.  Suppose you want to fix anger; you come up all the possible situations in which you’d react; now imagine yourself calm in when you’re in those.  Without imagining the situations, you’d still end up acting angry since the mind wasn’t trained in the right setting.

[^4]: Don’t print it or, worse, buy one.
[^5]: As opposed to reading, thinking or talking about driving.
[^6]: conversationalist
