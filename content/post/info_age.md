When I was young, my father used to give the _Young World_ section every Friday; I used to look forward to it.  While _activity books_ seem to instantly disengage a kid who’s just beginning.

Likewise, I’ve noticed, when giving suggestions to friends (on books, movies, etc.), giving one or two usually has a high conversion rate than giving a list and they never look at it.

Human mind, as noted before, has a hard time digesting complexity and voluminousness. 

In the _Age of Information_, one has to consciously cut through the noise and focus only on a limited set of ideas the mind can play with to produce something meaningful.
