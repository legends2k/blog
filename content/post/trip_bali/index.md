- Written in the imperative mood for prospective travellers who ask me to share this
- Based on our 2023 Oct visit; things might be different now

- Buy Telkomsel SIM at the airport; data-only and good enough
- Take Gojek (hail ride) all throughout (no travel agency)
- Use only bank's money exchangers all throughout

# Day 0

- Arrival at airport
- Purchase SIM with just data
    + Enough for Gojek, Grab and maps
- Check-in at Umasari Rice Terrace Villa at night

# Day 1

1. Visit Ubud and see
    + Sarawati Temple / Water Palace
    + Ubud Palace
    + Ubud art and street markets
    + Goa Gaja (ancient Indian temple)
2. Watch Kecak dance/drama of Ramayana [must-watch]
    + Efforts of performers kept even the kids spellbound

# Day 2

1. Visit Ulun Danu Beratan Temple [optional]
    + Most temples are like this but this one's popular
2. Visit some waterfall before hitting Tanah Lot
    + This was needless and delayed us for the next spot
3. Visit Tanah Lot for sunset [must-watch]
    + We got here late; poor visibility due to twilight
    + Wouldâ€™ve preferred to be here a bit earlier

# Day 3

1. Visit Bali Zoo [our kids enjoyed this a lot]
    + Deers roam in the open and can be fed directly
    + See free-roaming Orangutan up-close
    + See Meerkats up-close
    + Show with birds of prey 
2. Shift from Umasari to Besakih Beach Hotel, Sanur
    + All fast boats to Nusa Penida (T-Rex island) leave from Sanur
        - Nusa Penida is a must-watch
    + You've to anyway travel to & fro Sanur if you stay elsewhere
    + Dinner at an Indian restaurant

# Day 4

1. Chill out at Sanur beach (via private beach of Besakih Beach Hotel)
   + Kids cycled and played
   + Lot of Balinese food to try out on the beach
   + Mostly foreigners stay here
2. Eat at some beach restaurant
3. Shop

# Day 5

1. Board fast boat to Nusa Pendia (pre-booked on the internet)
2. Visit Nusa Penida and take a guided tour to
    + Snorkel at Manta Bay, Crystal Bay, etc. [enjoyable only if you swim well]
    + Broken beach
    + Angel's Billabong
    + Group photo with Kelingking Beach as backdrop (beach that looks like T-Rex)
        - Didn't visit the beach itself; it's at a very low altitude
    + Some stay in Nusa Penida and visit nearby islands too; we did just a day trip
3. Return back to Sanur
4. Checkout and check-in at Swiss-Belhotel, Kuta

# Day 6

1. Shopping in Kuta till early afternoon
2. Visit Uluwatu Temple
    + Very scenic but 1 hr drive
    + Watch Kecek dance here if you missed it in Ubud
    + Sunset is good here; can take great shots
3. Leave early as it's easy to not get any hail-ride cabs post sunset
    + Gets quite dark quickly; we had to walk quite a while to a restaurant alone
      and get a hail-ride from there

# Day 7

1. Check-out and departure
