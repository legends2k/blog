I recently moved from India to the Silicon Valley; it's almost a year now.  I have a few opinions I want to record under _notes-to-self_.  Before proceeding, I just want to be absolutely clear that these are _just my views_ and you're totally entitled to your's.  Though I try to be as reasonable as I can be, absolute logic isn't just impractical but is inapplicable since feelings about ones environment are always rooted in emotions, upbringing, habit, etc. but never in logic.   I'm just weighing up the odds from my angle.  Life in other states, or even cities might seem a lot different to what I saw.  Also I don't like/dislike/hero-worship people of any particular nation for I've seen good and bad ones in all groups and _isms_.

# Taste

## Clothes
I take the metro to work; two hours a day with _John Q. Public_.  During my commutes, one of the first things that struck me (as silly as it might be) was, the majority wore clothes of the same few shades: black, grey, white and sometimes blue; mostly sober colours.  There'll be some woman (never a man) in red, but that's infrequent, perhaps once a week.  Sure, it's for work, but almost everyone seemed to follow some unwritten rule; seemed strange. You might break the rule, but the norm isn't that; it's uncommon.

## Food
American food is quite bland; Americanized Mexican, Indian and Chinese are insipid too.  The dishes are definitely clean and well-served, but the flavours in them definitely leave you wanting.  As for the variety (of tastes themselves and not the dishes), you get bland, sweet or tangy.  I don't see much of hot, bitter, salty or astringent.  Sure, if you go to a place of a particular cuisine and ask, you'd perhaps get what you want, but naturally those aren't indigenous here.  Mind you, this is California, which people assured me is the most global of them all.  Apparently other states are more American.

When in India, I've seen a lot of men (let aside women) wearing red to work casually; business goes on as usual.  It's quite ordinary that it never becomes a thing.  As I drove past along tech. parks I used to see the same mix of a wide gamut of colours I saw elsewhere in tiny alleys.  With food, _rich_ is the word that comes to my mind, like the colours.  I've tasted a dozen different flavours under the same roof.  Another thing to notice is that food is mostly ordered piece-meal in India, while in the US it's mostly a complete meal; _the main, the side and the drink_ are always established when ordering[^1].  In India, it's common for my friends to go a restaurant, just order 4 sides, finish up and leave.  Again, there's this unwritten rule about the format.  _People seem to love having and following rules to the letter._

## Decorum and Decency
One thing many returning Indians keep praising (almost _bragging_) about US is how well-mannered people are; be it in the way doors are held or seats are offered to others and so on.  The major complaint about India, _by Indians_, is that people run and grab seats like "they've never seen 'em before".  Sure, I agree.  But wait, if you've observed this much, have you gone further to realize this?  When you've an abundance of something, giving that up

1. isn't going to hurt you
2. will gain you a false sense of moral high ground through a perceived "sacrifice"

Here, even after giving up seats, people end up getting a decent seat.  How about in situations where there's real dearth for resources?  Such is the state in my everyday my morning commutes where I've seen no one offering anything for others.  Why is that now?  Sometimes [politeness is a luxury](https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-needs-to-be-said/answer/Rashmi-Ravishankar); follow the link for real life examples of this.  In fact there were times when people forgot all about the lines and I saw a fish market in a jiffy.

This is an example when people openly broke laws when resources were limited[^2].  In India we just notice it often because the difference is well-pronounced but that doesn't change anything.  Oh scalability was a joke!  When many started breaking the rules, it's jungle law all around.  In addition, it showed their network's efficiency in handling congestion; the mobile signal went down because there were too many people in the same area (mall).  That was the amount of people I see regularly in a decent mall in India.  With lesser population and more resources it's mostly easy to put on a good show; but scalability starts rearing its ugly head only when it's the other way around.  This is a common problem in engineering; we observe its manifestation both in India and here.  Why should we turn a blind eye when it happens here?  If we keep portraying that this doesn't happen everywhere except India, of course young Indians will stupidly continue to say "we live in India, right?".  Are we not doing a disservice by not telling the truth?

The ratio of the amount of resources and the number of people that compete is very skewed between the East and the West.  I've seen Indians and Chinese to be fidgety even when there's an abundance, yes, but that comes from the fact that they come from where land (or resources in general) is much lesser than the people around; old habits die hard.

Americans didn't have this problem: there were times when the land they had was so much that they'd to keep races to give away a piece of land to whoever reaches it first.  Ever heard of terms like [Sooners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooner) or [land rushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_run)? :)  However, when courtesy comes in the way of their work, they forget all about it, just like people of other nations do.  **Nothing wrong in that**, nothing to be corrected here; survival of the fittest isn't new, is it?  If anything, it's just one's perception that "they are _always_ polite" needs correction.  No one is always something; it's always the situation, it depends, like everything else.  I'm just refuting the image perpetrated by returning Indians.  People who have never been to, or are new to US, think it's a la-la land, when it's not; it's just another nation with its pluses and minuses.  Please let's not paint a rosy picture to boost one's own ego about where one lives.

## Order
Everyone has a schedule, a set routine for the entire week; people follow calendars quite well here.  Everyone loves a good routine; they say that living organized lets us do more.  Here, one can clearly say, at a given point in time, where one will be, doing what; 90% of the times it's accurate.  I've never been able to do this in India give how chaotic it could get; but in the US I live a very predictable life.

In India too there's some loosely-formed routine but still nothing too rigid and it shows; majority don't keep referring to their calendars about their future whereabouts.  But seriously, does life have to be this formal in the name of efficiency?  And what are we chasing being so efficient?  I feel enjoying now is more important that saving for a rainy day.

### Kids
I noticed that even kids[^3] have a schedule and are busy here.  I've seen kids in India go to a neighbouring house freely without asking for permission or booking an appointment a priori like it's a doctor's office.  In the US, kids play on a pre-planned [_play date_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_date).  Since it's now formalized, meeting other kids and playing on the street is an uncommon site for people living in their own houses.  Now, we as parents do want our kids to lessen their screen times but our busy schedules just tend to increase that.  Well, grand parents aren't around to tell stories either.  So to entertain them in-house, people tend to buy a lot of toys, which in turn tends to lessen their sharing abilities and heighten their possessiveness.  Shouldn't it be less formal atleast for the kids?  I think being a kid is all about being silly and goofing around, messing up and learning new things.  Honestly, I don't see that happening here mostly.  They seem to live in a very controlled environment; quite disciplined.  We want to beget creative humans or bots?!

[^3]: I'm only taking about Indian kids.  I've not gotten a chance to observe American kids at their homes.

### Cities and Brands
Most cities look the same.  I've travelled to the East and the West costs of the country.  In every city I see that there's a shopping district and houses built around.  Then there're roads connecting to the highways.  If you've seen one city, you've seen almost all other cities, since the framework is quite the same, with some variations here and there.  So even the cities are extremely well-planned and orderly.

Likewise, there're these brands which you'll see everywhere.  For shopping there are some 5 to 6 brands you keep seeing from coast to coast.  It's too regular.  The items you get and the models you see are extremely predictable.  When you walk into two different stores of the same brand, you'd end up seeing the same stuff.  They look so similar that at times I confused a shop in some other city for the one in my city!  Monopoly is the name of the game.  Even for food, you see a few chains dominating the scene.  Thank God in San Francisco the small players are still a thing but that's the exception and not the norm; norm is that the small fishes are usually killed by the bigger ones.

## Opening Up
People don't tend to talk very much here.  On some of my trips in the metro, for the entire hour, I've sensed pin-drop silence.  This is impossible in India.  It could be a bus, a rick or a car, people keep yapping about something or the other.  We tend to discount this as something pointless and not give lot of value to this.  In the US, people seem to like their privacy and prefer being left alone doing their own thing.  Socializing is still a formal thing properly planned.  A common sight in India that I glaringly miss here: a bunch of people standing in a tea stall, laughing about nothing, making jokes and probably with little to no money on them.  Sure, they've their problems (might be poor), but psychological issues usually isn't one of them since they _speak up_.

{{< figure src="/images/valley_review/silent_metro.jpg" title="Quite full and quiet!" >}}

[Research](https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Kaizen-Creating-Lasting-Excellence/dp/0071796177) shows that the mark of the most successful, healthy minds is opening up when there's an issue; the one quality that's very important as a human is when you're troubled, you admit it, first to yourself, and reach out for help; share it with someone, you suddenly see it almost halved or gone.  In India, the opportunities to speak up and the amount of friends you could make[^4] are quite numerous.  They don't differentiate with categories such as friends, acquaintances, colleagues, room-mates, etc.   You're either a friend or not.  You go out to tea with someone twice, you're suddenly their _dhosth_[^5].  Here I've worked for a year in a very small office of 20, unlike in India where there more than thousand employees, and I don't know even one personally well.  They strictly maintain their professional relationship.

## Chaos vs Order
The system in the US is such that you've to live a planned life.  Living unplanned would get you penalized one way or the other.  Take travel; you've to (a) check on the climate (it's not a tropical country, the climate is erratic) (b) workout the routes (without maps one cannot get anywhere owing to how many roads there are).  Even in that you've to be organised since you cannot make stops in the freeway; \(c) make sure you hit the loo before leaving home.  Oh to change and take a different road, (d) you've to plan ahead and change lanes, otherwise you cannot take that road!

Throughout the article I've highlighted how these plans, rules and formalities in the West try to keep things in place; they're a means to avoid chaos; to devise a _method in the madness_.  However, I feel that by living a very planned, organised life, we resist change, we try to avoid life take its course, in giving randomness a hand.  However, both in India and the US[^6] life happily does it's magic and throws us off our balance; for better or worse.  Pleasant surprises and black swan events keep happening everywhere.  What's the difference then?  Well, it's just in the mind; how well you train it.  By not being too rigid, the change affects you lesser; flexibility allows one to embrace change more gently than the ones who resist it so much.  By that I'm not saying we've to live in anarchy, sure some planning is definitely needed; but driving it to an extreme is going to set us up for more anxiety.

Let's say you've thrived in chaos, would you be able to do well in order?  Of course, see how many Indians migrate to the US and do well for themselves.  However, I'll tell you something about the opposite traffic.  I've a friend who has coffee in the morning everyday.  We are always worried going with him on a unplanned, random trip.  Why?  Being orderly, having a set routine only made things difficult both for him and us.  Once you've a habit, it makes you dependant on multiple things; in this case the condition that we're not on road, that we get coffee decoction, that we get milk[^7] and that we're in a place that can provide these things.  One, just one thing goes wrong, he'd not get his coffee and  be grumpy thereby spoiling the trip.  However, the same place, not having coffee, might've had other things to offer like hot tea and delicious [samosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samosa), but since our friend is hell bent on coffee, he cannot appreciate these that're here and now.

Kids coming from the US to India carry so many things with them; everything has to be _just so_ since you're used to a certain level of comfort, but that very comfort makes you not enjoy other things that a different place has to offer; they make you very narrow-minded and tunnel-visioned.  Take elders; many people try to avoid having an elder at their homes.  When you ask them why, they say, "well, if it's just our family we adjust and have what we have, but with elders you've to make sure everything is as per their needs, else they're unhappy".  The more flexible you're, the more welcomed you'll be.  We should remember that rules and formalities are man-made and chaos is the reality.  These man-made formalities are there for our betterment and not to deter us from being happy, not blind us from appreciating the now.

Have you noticed how Indian dishes are prepared?  There'll be multiple levels of processes that happen before food reaches the plate.  It's not as straight as just cutting a few vegetables, some raw meat and tossing them on a bread.  Have you also noticed that most characters in the Latin script are flat while most Indic language scripts are curvy?[^8]  As an environment, I feel, having a lot of variety and depth to things with lots of twists and turns is more enjoyable, yes?  Last I checked, many tagged routine as boring.
