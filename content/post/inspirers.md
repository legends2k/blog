I have been inspired by many unknown authors all over the internet and otherwise, but a few lingered on my mind long enough to be listed here.  Not all of them are authors, but they inspired me with some creative work of theirs.

## Kalki R. Krishnamurthy
[A *great* writer][Kalki], and freedom fighter, who effortlessly balanced content against gripping narration.  He pioneered in writing under a unique genre --- Historical fiction --- by mixing imagination with facts in the right amount and proved that it can be done with [great success][Ponniyin Selvan].  He's the only author I have seen to give evidences in a fictional work.  Though *[Tamil][]* is my mother tongue, I am sure I am unbiased here.

## Joel Spolsky
Witty, provoking and insightful writer of technical topics.  I like many of his articles, but these are worth mentioning.

+ [Can your programming language do this?][]
+ [Perils of Java Schools][]
+ [The Law of Leaky Abstractions][]
+ [In Defense of Not-Invented-Here Syndrome][]

## Eris S. Raymond
Hacker, writer who defined the defining characteristics of a hacker.  If you are a programmer, or are aspiring to becoming a good one, I strongly recommend you know

## Dennis M. Ritchie
He's creator of the *C* programming language, co-author of *The C Programming Language* and the poster child for the *[Unix Philosophy][]*.  His writings are, to me, the canonical example of clear, concise technical content.  If you haven't read [The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing system][], do so to see how pipes came into computers and why coroutines are cool.

## Scott H. Young
This man successfully completed MITâ€™s 4-year undergraduate computer science curriculum in 12 months, *without taking any classes*.  He also devised the [Feynman technique][] you may use to learn any topic in any domain.  He has written many great articles of which [one stands out][hello, world] as an inspiration.

## Richard Feynman
He needs no introduction.  [His essays on Physics][Feynman essays] are the go-to literature if you are an amateur physicist.

## Carl Sagan
An astronomer who was behind the SETI project.  I like him more for *[Cosmos][]*.  I always fall for his *[Pale Blue Dot][]*; makes me realise how insignificant humans are in the grand scheme of things and reminds me to make good use of the limited time I have.

## Jerry Seinfeld
Big fan of his comedies, but as a creator, he freely shares his secret recipe: *[The Seinfeld Technique][]*.

## Daniel Kahneman
I was dumb struck when I watched [his Ted talk][Daniel Kahneman] that explains the experiencing self and the remembering self.  I came to know its implications later when I started mediating.

## And more
People like *Salman Khan*, the educator, *Amit Patel*, whose blog is a treasure trove of interactive articles for a game developer, and numerous other open source developers like *Richard M Stallman*,  *Linus Torvalds*, who open up their work for the betterment of humanity and respect freedom are my inspirations too.
