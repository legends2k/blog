+ Atma is like electricity; body and mind are like appliances (e.g. fans)
    * Devices might come in different sizes, doing different kind of work, having pleasing to disgusting appearance, etc.
    * Electricity driving all such appliances is the same; you can’t see electricity but it’s there
    * A device void of electricity is just a brick
    * Driving force behind every life form is atma; person, animal, creature, size, colour, etc. doesn’t matter
    * Once atma leaves the “body” it’s just that e.g. no one says “lift Mr. Kannadasan”
+ Everyone’s essence is atma; like every device’s essence is electricity
+ What’s changing can’t be the truth.  Beauty, roles (if a grandma dies the role of grandson ceases), money,
  position, etc. keep changing; such temporal entities aren’t/can’t be the truth.
+ When you’ve an issue with someone, try to realize that it’s the fan that’s defunct but not the electricity
    * The electricity/life force is the same even within the other person
    * Every person is really the atma driving them; why bother looking at the body/container?
    * If there’s a defect with a fan, you don’t blame electricity for it
    * Taking an issue with someone and blaming the person (atma) is stupid.  Blaming the container is even stupider.
+ Stop identifying yourself (and others) as the body or mind or in a role
    * While travelling in a car, if someone asks your name, you don’t say the car’s name
    * Your body and mind which arose from this world is just a container like a car
    * You can’t call yourself this container; you’re the sole/atma
    * After acting in _Bheema_ role on stage, you no longer call yourself _Bheema_ in real life
    * Likewise, stop identifying yourself and others with a role; identify with paramatma by seeing the all connecting atma
    * You assume different bhavas temporarily in this life; roles arise and fall like the waves; don’t hold on to them
      and put yourself through constant duress
    * Keep coming out them quickly and realize that everyone is powered by the soul and we’re working for that.
+ Having a general goal is OK; use that for practical decision-making
+ Enjoy the travel in pursuing the goal at a high-level more relaxed and enjoying the work
+ Anyways you’re going to do work that’s unavoidable; why not do it with full involvement
    * Doing a work with full involvement/enjoyment leads to
        - Unearthing new talents/skills
        - Realizing bumping into something more important than the original goal you’ve set
        - Healthier mind and both
        - Longer life, lesser stress, more enjoyment and appreciation 24 × 7
+ Agnanam: giving importance to role, material, etc.
    * When someone gives you a work, you shouldn’t be doing it as a worker who’s doing work for another owner
    * This mindset leads to a misalignment; the delta becomes a depression in the mind
    * “I’m doing this work for him; it’s not my work.  Let me do it grudgingly, just for duty-sake, I’ll do it
      without love, attention or compassion.”
    * This leads to the work becoming a burden to mind and physical body
    * This leads to suffering, depression and other physical and mental problems ensuing further issues
+ Gnanam: giving importance to the sole and owning the work
    * Bhava: assume you’re the owner once you’ve any work to do.  Do it with the same joy and attention you’d have
      when you’ve a 1 cr. cheque that you need to drop into your account.
    * Biggest realization: do it for your well-being!  Doing all work happily leads to physical and mental excellence
    * Anyways you’re going to do it, do it properly and finish it with happiness.  You’d avoid mental and physical
      issue and get mental satisfaction as bonus.
    * We’re running low on time and are stuck in a traffic signal; we think it’s someone else’s traffic
      signal that we have to abide by.  This delta, this misalignment leads us to think we’re above it
    * We pass judgemental comments on how’s unneeded, how it could be solved more intelligently, etc. which doesn’t
      solve the problem in hand.  It just increases our anxiety and tension.
    * Instead if we realize we’re all part of a greater system/society.  These’re rules formed by us, for us, directly or
      indirectly (as a society) and we follow it for our good.
    * Sure, there are issues that come up due to this now and then.  We can try to solve it as part of the system,
      without getting emotional, productively.  Accept the fact and prepare for such situations beforehand (starting
      early, using a different route, etc.)
+ We do work properly, not avoid shortcuts, live with dharma, etc. for a very simple reason: productivity and efficiency
    * When you’ve a mental divide when doing something, the pain it leads to, the guilt you end up with, etc. leads
      to not being able to sleep properly, not having a clean conscience, etc.
    * This leads to more lesser efficiency in doing your future work, showing your talent, unearthing new talents and
      learning new skills
+ Limited vs Unlimited Responsibility
    * After the work has been assigned and completed.  It’s common to see us taking credit if praised while passing
      the buck when things go wrong
    * Giving excuses, pointing fingers leads to a further tumultuous mind; one can’t be happy by taking half responsibility
    * Taking unlimited responsibility, taking ownership, without passing the buck leads to peace of mind
    * Some might see us in a low light for a failure; so what?  Everyone makes mistakes, if a smaller mind can’t
      accept it, so be it.  Some will also see us in good light for the honesty and sincerity.
    * Once can’t always please everyone; one can’t be in everyone’s good books.  If you keep worrying about how we’ll
      be seen by others, we’re getting needless stress, plus our other duties and enjoyable work gets hampered.
    * Once we accept our fault, we become solution-finders, not fault finders.  We explore different solutions in our
      mind and venture to try one.
    * Out cortex is an excellent tool to generate possibilities/options.  When you take responsibility accept your fault,
      it’ll work and come up with solution options; when shed responsibility, it’ll come up with grand excuses!
    * At a deeper level, we’re responsible for everything that happens (to us).  We’re responsible for our very birth!
+ Doing anything without full attention leads to mistakes; this has repercussions on us and others; it’s sometimes called
  a sin for this very reason e.g. someone’s carelessness in Bhopal/Chernobyl lead to a disaster.

+ A leader is someone who realizes absolute responsibilities and shows it in every action
+ Aanmeegam is nothing but karma; being aware of its consequences -- being a leader
+ Animals are like fixed-function pipeline; they’re pre-programmed while humans are like shader-based pipeline.  Humans can change and choose based on realizations.
    * Overall events/outcomes might be karma-/fate-decided but every moment-to-moment action is very much in your control
    * How we perceive/look at an event/happening/person can be changed.  By this even the pain/pleasure can be perceived differently.
+ _Gnana unavru_ leads to peaceful mind/body, ability/drive to solve the problem and better bring out our talents
+ Doing something by taking into consideration the world, even to the slightest amount, leads to being a leader

* Deadline: Have a (personal, if not official) deadline for any work.  Without this, we go into inattentive lazy mood and do distracted work.  Given a chunck of time, without breaking into smaller tasks with deadlines, there’re no guardrails for the mind and it’s easy to get off track.  Keep watch of time every now and then and re-prioritize, if needed.
* Goal: Setting a goal is okay for a long-term direction; it helps in taking decisions.  However, moment-to-moment we should be hung up on the goal.  Say we’re going in search of a peral on a bus.  If we’re so set on thinking only about what we should do once we get to our destination, we might miss the diamonds under our seat, giving us moment-to-moment unease when seated.  Had we paid attention to it, we’d have gotten diamonds instead of perals.  If we spoke to the people around cheerfully, we might get a faster route in reaching our destionation.
* Never do for appreciation; many times you wouldn’t get it.  Do it for your satisfaction and taking absolute responsibility.

* Sakthi (energy) picks up matter when it has desires (some kind of longing)
  - That’s when life is formed on material earth
  - Death is when we lose all matter and go back to pure energy state
  - Materialistic possession including body is left behind
  - Mukthi is when we don’t return back as matter; we sustain in the energy state
* Appreciation is pleasure; not peranandham or nithyanandam
  - It’s just another kink of the mind
* Accept reality -- that’s happiness
* This moment is reality, this moment -- it’s nature or results -- can’t be changed when it happens
  - you can’t change this moment (or an entities swabhava that kshanam)
  - accept that you’re not the owner but the custodian
  - reaction just doesn’t help change the moment’s results/nature
  - if your son takes 45 marks, scolding/beating at that moment doesn’t change it to even 45.5; accept it
  - since you’re the care taker, calmly talk to him and work on his improvement sensibly
  - if you don’t accept and react, still you’ve to work on the improvement but after some mind/body suffering for yourself and son
  - even if you think someone/something else might have a better plight, that’s just an illusion, not reality.  Also everyone has problems, their own kind.
* So what, what next?
  - Accept everything and think what to do next impersonally
  - Give up only until getting soul satisfaction
  - Do your best and leave the rest to Him
  - Some examples where acceptance is no longer a problem: pregnancy, spectacles, nose ring.  Same can be done with other real world situations.
* Gnanis will have pain too, but they won’t be suffering
  - Two arrows of pain in Buddhism
* Acceptance is heaven and non-acceptance is hell
* Everyone has a certain amount of pain one has to go through.  It’s wiser to split it into numerous smaller fragments (yoga, defeats in life, tolerance/acceptance, etc.) and experience them instead of first only enjoying and later only suffering.
