Easty and Westy
======================

Say you have a dream of making something; it might be a product, a game or art.  I've seen predominantly two approaches taken.  One is to just work on the _stuff that matters_ and rapidly getting closer to what you envisioned in your head; the end product.  The emphasis here is specifically not worrying about schedule, design, procedure --- the things that don't actually go into the deliverable, but might make your head feel better.  The other approach is to form detailed plans --- design documents, work schedules, tests --- and then working in a _one step forward, two steps backwards_ way; execute one item from the to-do list, check if things are fine, verify assumptions -- repeat.  For easier reference, let's call the former _Easty_ and the latter _Westy_.

Both approaches start with a pressing desire to realize a dream; love for something.  However, the approaches diverge quite a bit after that.  Easty works just for the product, without worrying about insulating for future issues that might crop up; not concerning about how much profit one can make out of the result.  It doesn't care about what a critique, lawyer or VC might say (who cares, it's my dream); it's a very right-brain oriented approach.  Westy is more careful; it wants to make sure there's a deadline, there's enough viability, demand in the market, making sure it's future-proof.  To achieve these one has to make informed choices about what raw materials to choose from, how did a previous camper achieve success in a similar vein, etc.  Did you notice that Westy is worried about success more than about the product itself?

Neither is right or wrong.  Some projects might be more Westy-oriented like planning a city, but here too the work itself is designing the road, again doing is more important.  Sure, one should think, but keeping on thinking isn't the way to go.  After a good initial plan, it'd be better to start executing it.
Analysis paralysis.

People were happy making and selling caps.  It's only when people started wanting an ecosystem for the cap business that most evil started in the business world.  This securing for the future is showing how much insecurity one has about the future.
Invariably making makes one happier; ideating, well, not so much.  I just makes you _feel_ better.  While making you're actually happy; not thinking about happiness and feeling better.

A college of mine and I were talking about Nintendo and how it compares with Playstation and Xbox.  Nintendo, apparently, is notorious for giving bad tools for their game consoles for people to make games on their platform.  However, their business model is not around other making games for their consoles but they themselves make strong IP games like Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and so on.  In doing so, they think of their console ecosystem as a product, not worrying about making an SDK like its competitors.  Making an SDK doesn't give anything tangiable directly to the customer; making a game does.  That's all seems to be the drive of Nintendo; for them the roduct ends there.  Making a SDK gives them a secure future by making an ecosystem, letting other _partnering_ studios build killer games will _probably_ give them a more secure future, but they don't seem to care.  For them the product is their console and the games they make to run on it, so that end users hae something to play; their original dream of _making games_.  Their minds are deeply entrenched in the present that they can't be bothered with the future.  So tomorrow Nintendo might be gone, but hey, tommorow for all we know, we might be gone too.  Now don't get analytical with probability and stuff.  If one can happen, the other can too (as long as the probability is not 0).


This matters even if you're an artist.  I've seen artists arrive at great solutions by being at it and making corrections along the way; they go with _the flow_ as they make their strokes, without stopping and actually sitting somewhere thinking how to proceed or what to correct; see videos of artists making excellent pieces.  Somehow this is the case mostly with only artists.  Many other fields keep ideating with only little execution on the actual product itself.

The West mostly tries to shield itself from future issues by making schedules, to-do lists, etc.; basically worrying about the future.  The East is concerned about now.  Making the product that good now and not worrying about how to make it profitable or to secure a good future for the company.  This is perhaps one of the reasons why we see more software from the West and hardware from the East.  Hardware needs doing while software needs thinking.

Obsessive planning for the future to avoid failure leads to not living in the present.  It’s directly at odds with living in the moment philosopy.  However, not having a direction and going about aimlessly might not scale up to run a family or complete an endeavour, etc.  Perhaps the right balance is to have a long term goal and go towards it but course-correct as you go; even to the level of completely change to a different goal.  If you’re too hung up on the goal you’ll miss opportunies life sends your way to become something else that what your conscious mind is yearning for e.g. Kalam thatha wanting to become a fighter jet pilot but becoming a missle scientist.
