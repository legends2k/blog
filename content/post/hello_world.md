# Some Experience
I have been writing on [StackOverflow][] (SO) for quite a while now.  I don't know if this can be called writing since it's only technical content.  However, helping newbies with verbose answers has stoked some confidence in me; confidence that I am good at explaining things to people.  This also gave me a taste for good, clear explanations and I dare say, good writing in general.

# Search for Intuition
I am a patron of [Better Explained][] --- where Kalid Azad explains technical concepts, like Calculus, Physics, in a way that builds intuition.  I share this belief with him: **technical topics are tagged thus only because they are presented in a bad fashion to freshers**.  Oodles of symbol --- jargon, code; take your pick --- vomit and no fun would naturally steer a fresher away!  No wonder many books are tagged *boring* in this day and age.

> Every master was once a beginner.

Remembering this fact, building intuition should be the prime effort of teachers; for once the learner is hooked, they would naturally delve into the details -- rigour -- of the subject.  I belong to the camp that says sacrifing rigour for intuition is OK.  My intention is to not just write.  I believe mere words are not enough to get the idea through; images and interactive content are essential.

# Writing -- a powerful tool
Scott H. Young's [*Writing to Solve Personal Problems*][Scott Young's article] that begins

> An incredibly powerful technique for solving problems is by simply writing it down. It seems rather simple, but it can often allow you to solve problems you previously thought were impossible.

left a strong impression on me.  I have unconciuosly done this many times but when he put it out there like that, it solidified in my mind; another instance on why writing things down is a good thing.  I realised how powerful a tool writing is.

# Learner âž° Writer
I am a depth-oriented guy.  I keep exploring various topics --- programming, math, science --- and I find it hard to build intuition.  I take my time in understanding various pieces of a topic until they fall in place in my head; the penny *finally* drops.  Once internalised, [I write code][code] to concretise my comprehension of the concept.  I embellish code generously with comments to make sure in future I *get* what I groked.  As I kept writing these comments I realised something deeper.  Just the act of writing comments, with the intention of explaining it, not to myself, but to someone else deepened my understanding and filled the holes in my mental model.

However, I find it selfish to leave the bread crumbs in comments.  How many people read code to understand something?  Also how can one put the aforementioned interactive learning tools into comments?  This is a place where I try to explain things that occured to me in hopes that it helps others in having the joy of understanding something intuitively.  I hope to give life to words with images and interactive tools along the way.  Instead of complaining about someone's writing saying I couldn't build intuition, I want to add my ounce of effort to the mix.

# Rise of good tools
A learner should be able to visualise and play with ideas in a tangible way to seal one's understanding.  A very good example of this is [Explorable Explanations][].  I belive well-written books still have their place in driving the point home.  Such books can leverage modern tools to paint a clearer picture and attract beginners too.  These days we see programming books with embedded interpreters for readers to try out the exercise within the comfort of their browsers; we see physics explanations with playable demos where the reader can change parameters to observe corresponding change in the phenomenon.

Such tools are made possible by open technologies like HTML5, JavaScript and SVG.  Atop these, writing a blog is made trivial with many *static site generators*, like [Hugo][], which lets create rich content without leaving your [favourite text editor][Emacs].  They also do not restrict you to just words like popular blogging platforms; you are free to embed content as rich as games, math equations and vector graphics to express yourself in your own style.  When the idea of starting this site occured to me, I wrote [a demo page][hugo test] that verifed this.

# No such thing as a stupid question
There is a very high probablity of errors creeping into the content.  *If a reader is unable to understand something, I'm convienced that it's my ineptitude as a mentor and not the learner's*.  I would really appriciate you pointing out such errors.

In addition to these, [many][inspirors] have inspired me.
