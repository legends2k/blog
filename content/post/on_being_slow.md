A colleague told me about two types of processors

1. _Internal Processor_: A person who gives one clear statement -- externally; formulates what to say, makes corrections to it, etc. -- internally
2. _External Processor_: A person who says something without thinking then corrects it and then some more correction...

I’ve mostly been an external processor.  I’m clumsy and impatient.  I’m impulsive and judgemental too.  I’m intuition-driven; deliberate, thought-through actions are a rarity.  Though my intuition has mostly helped me, I’ve been bitten by over-confidence.

A healthy balance between the approaches is needed.  Since I’m already erring on the impulsive side, I’d benefit more from balancing the equation by being more deliberate in my actions.  I’ve observed becoming more deliberate after I started meditation practise.

> Meditation seems to balance.  If you’re a slow person it makes you fast enough, if you’re a fast person it slows you down enough.


# Talking

I’m an introvert; I don’t speak much in a setting with unknown folks.  With close friends it’s quite the opposite!  Even with strangers, after a couple of meetings, I start to feel comfortable and could easily speak for more than half hour with the other just listening.  This is useful at times but it has its downsides.  I used to be completely unaware of whether they’re enjoying it or getting bored; this has improved a bit.

A huge realization over the years: cutting down on talking makes me a lot more productive, improves my relationships with better conversations.  Furthermore, it leads to many silent realizations.  My mind needs the calm to correctly bring up the point I want to talk about; both in personal and professional front.

# Listening

I’m still working on my listening; I could do a lot better.  I frequently interrupt; I disrupt the flow --- sometimes with my _Captain Obvious_ comments, other times with interesting observations.  When I was working in San Francisco, I got direct professional feedback on cutting folks off.  I quickly worked on it and came off as a decent listener.  However, I got back to my old ways when I returned back.  I seem to need a strict rule or authority to be a good listener.  My mind intellectually knows a lot of benefits in listening but to bring it in practise feels harder.  I hope to improve myself as listener.

[Kaizen] should help.  Minimal goal: listen at least on point with [evenly-hovering attention][], without any judgement-passing at the back of my mind.
