# Conflict Resolution

* Conflict: struggle between incompatible needs/ideas/wishes/etc.
* Type’re a part of day-to-day life, thinking they should never happen is meaningless/impractical
* Everyone show traits from one/both parents
* Children get _modelled_ by parents
* 10% of conflict is truly due to difference of opinion, rest _90% wrong tone of voice_!
* There’re non-negotiables with all people e.g. some wife feeling extra-marital affair is okay but only when there’s no emotional dependency
* Thomas-Kilmann Model - Conflict Resolution (a model by two psychologists)
  1. Accommodating
    - Not assertive at all / some cooperativeness
    - Useful when winning is unimportant, relationship is
  2. Compromising
    - Generally not good if you’re doing it prolonged
    - Useful when it’s the need of the hour
    - When consensus cannot be arrive at
    - If you’re unassertive it’s worse internally
  3. Collaborative
    - Kinda the best style
    - Useful almost always, but impractical many times :(
    - Ensures that every team member is considered and their points are discussed/involved
    - Time-taking; can’t be used in a critical/crucial situation
  4. Avoiding
    - Neither assertive/cooperative
    - Usually helpless to involved parties
    - Useful when emotions are running high
  5. Competing
    - Comes with lot of assertiveness/very non-cooperative
    - They’re very sure about their goals
    - They want things to be done as per their requirement often
    - Used by authoritative/ranked people as they get away with it
    - Useful when there’s an urgency, but not generally
* One has a predominant style, but switched depending on situations
* Some skills worth developing for conflict resolution
  - Self-awareness and emotional regulation
  - Checking in for motivation
    * What’re you driven by?
  - Empathy
    * Useful in diffusing the situation and then understand the other party
  - Social skills
    * Know your strengths and agree some aren’t solvable from your position
  - Problem solving
  - Frequent relationship checks
    * Checking with people regularly to know things are okay with them
    * Show your availability
  - Communication skills
  - Forgiveness
    * Research says it’s sort of the best way
    * This is different from compromising, since you’re actually okay with it in this case
    * Know how you uncover your anger on the person/situation/group
    * Work on forgiveness since holding on wouldn’t anyways help
    * Move on and discover and release yourself from your own emotional prison
    * Needs enough preparation, not simple, done step-by-step; ask questions and explore your answers
